            This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down: </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
            <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
        </ol>
